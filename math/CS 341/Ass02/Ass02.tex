\textbf{1. Write a RAM program for the following problem: you are given a list $L$ of $n-1$ integers $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{n-1}$ for some $n\geq2$, and you are told that $L$ contains every number in $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ exactly once (in unknown order), except that one number $m$ is missing. You must find $m$, the missing number. \\\\
Try to find the most efficient algorithm (in terms of time and space) you can, under the unit-cost model. Your solution will be marked on efficiency and correctness.}

We note that the sum of the entire set $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ is equal to $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, a well-known identity. Since $L$ is missing exactly one of the elements of that set, $m$, we know that the sum of $L$ will be 
\[\sum{L}=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}-m \implies \boxed{m=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}-\sum{L}}\]
Thus our algorithm need only sum together the elements of $L$ (in $O(n)$ time), and subtract it from $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, in $O(1)$ time, for a total runtime cost of $O(n)$. Since it is absolutely necessary to read in every element of $L$ in order to solve this problem, we can be reasonably certain that no substantial improvement over this algorithm is possible.

So let us get down to actually implementing the algorithm:
